How to Make An Entry:

1.make a json file with the metadata you want:
	a.bare minimum are 'loader' and 'system' - those two will tell the frontend where the entry goes and what to load.
	b.upload the json with the description: cFE_ETRY

2.upload all your artwork (videos,images,etc)
	a.In description, write the entry tag cFE_ARTW followed by the uuid of the entries you want it to be used for separated by commas:
		e.g. 'cFE_ARTW:Ti18zIyax06rXX7vzF9k8Q,OXDEM5V2JEaBYDgvegkrDg'

3.upload the icon for the entry, 
	a.Basically idential to artwork,write the entry tag cFE_ICON followed by the uuid of the entries you want it to be used for separated by commas:
	e.g. 'cFE_ICON:Ti18zIyax06rXX7vzF9k8Q,OXDEM5V2JEaBYDgvegkrDg'
	
4.Now for the data - it can be in any format provided your loader can handle it.
	a. Upload all your data files. If you have multiple data files (extra patches, updates, etc), files will overwrite their previous counterparts when
		the loader uses them. Feel free to overlay contents on top of one another.
	b. In the description, write the entry tag cFE_DATA followed by the uuid of the entries you want the data to be used with separated by commas.
		e.g. ' cFE_DATA:OXDEM5V2JEaBYDgvegkrDg,Ti18zIyax06rXX7vzF9k8Q' would be used with two entries.

5. OPTIONAL - if you need to upload a "loader" for a new system,
	a. upload a zip file of the loader's files with an __init__.py included with a run() that takes one argument - the path to the files to use.
	b. In description, write the entry tag cFE_LODR, followed by a comma separated list of pipe separated values for System|NativeOS|ldr_name
		e.g. 'cFE_LODR:PC Windows|nt|pc_windows' or 'cFE_LODR:Super Nintendo|nt|zsnes,Super Nintendo|posix|zsnes'
